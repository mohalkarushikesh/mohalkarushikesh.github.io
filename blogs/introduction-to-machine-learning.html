            <b>Machine Learning (ML)</b> is a key branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data rather than relying on explicit instructions.
            By recognizing patterns in historical examples, ML models can make predictions, classify information, or recommend actions autonomously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional programming, where every rule must be manually coded, ML systems improve automatically with more data and experience, making them adaptable to dynamic environments.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Supervised Learning:</b> The model is trained on labeled data, where the correct output is known. Examples include predicting house prices with historical sales data or classifying emails as spam or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> The model analyzes unlabeled data to identify hidden structures, clusters, or patterns. Use cases include customer segmentation and anomaly detection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> The model learns to make decisions through trial and error, guided by rewards and penalties. Common in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bias–Variance Tradeoff:</b> Balancing underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance) is critical to generalization. Regularization, cross-validation, and careful feature selection help achieve this balance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Feature Engineering:</b> Transforming raw data into meaningful input variables to improve model performance. For example, extracting the day of the week from a timestamp may help in sales predictions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Algorithms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear and Logistic Regression – simple, interpretable models for continuous or categorical outcomes.</li>
            <li>Decision Trees and Random Forests – capture non-linear relationships and interactions.</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machines – effective in high-dimensional spaces.</li>
            <li>Neural Networks – flexible models capable of learning complex patterns, widely used in image, speech, and text processing.</li>
            <li>Ensemble Methods – combine multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Typical Machine Learning Lifecycle</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Define the problem and success metric.</li>
            <li>Collect and clean data, ensuring quality and relevance.</li>
            <li>Split data into training, validation, and test sets.</li>
            <li>Select or design a model and train it on the training data.</li>
            <li>Evaluate using validation data and tune hyperparameters.</li>
            <li>Test the final model on unseen data and deploy in production.</li>
            <li>Monitor performance and retrain as new data becomes available.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommender systems – Netflix, Spotify, Amazon suggestions.</li>
            <li>Search ranking and advertising – optimizing which content to show users.</li>
            <li>Medical diagnostics – detecting diseases in images like X-rays or MRIs.</li>
            <li>Fraud detection – monitoring financial transactions for anomalies.</li>
            <li>Natural language processing – chatbots, sentiment analysis, and translation services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For beginners, the key is to start with small, well-defined problems. Build a baseline model, understand the data deeply, validate carefully, and iterate. 
            Success in machine learning is often more about data quality, problem framing, and validation than using the most complex algorithms.
