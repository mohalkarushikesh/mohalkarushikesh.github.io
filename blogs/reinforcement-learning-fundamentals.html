            <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b> is a branch of machine learning focused on sequential decision-making. 
            An agent interacts with an environment, taking actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time. 
            Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled data but instead learns from feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Agent and Environment:</b> The agent is the learner or decision-maker, while the environment is everything the agent interacts with.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>State, Action, Reward:</b> At each step, the agent observes the state, selects an action, and receives a reward based on that action. 
                The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Discount Factor:</b> Determines how future rewards are weighted compared to immediate rewards, balancing short-term vs. long-term gain.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Value Functions and Q-functions:</b> Value functions estimate expected rewards from states, while Q-functions estimate rewards from state-action pairs. 
                Bellman equations formalize these relationships for iterative computation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Exploration vs. Exploitation:</b> The agent must balance exploring new strategies to find better rewards and exploiting known strategies to maximize reward.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Popular Algorithms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Tabular Methods:</b> Simple approaches like dynamic programming and Q-learning for small discrete state-action spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Deep Q-Networks (DQN):</b> Combines neural networks with Q-learning to handle large, continuous state spaces, enabling deep reinforcement learning.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Policy Gradient Methods:</b> Directly learn policies by optimizing expected reward. Algorithms include REINFORCE, Actor-Critic methods, PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Robotics: Autonomous navigation, manipulation, and motion planning.</li>
            <li>Games: AI agents mastering complex games like Go, Chess, and video games.</li>
            <li>Operations and Resource Management: Dynamic resource allocation, inventory optimization, and scheduling.</li>
            <li>Autonomous Vehicles: Learning driving policies under varying road conditions and traffic patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Practices and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Designing effective RL systems requires careful attention to reward function design, simulation before deployment, and monitoring for distribution shifts. 
            Poorly specified rewards can lead to unintended behaviors, and training in realistic simulations helps ensure robust performance in real-world environments.
