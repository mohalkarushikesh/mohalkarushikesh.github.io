        <p>
            Computer Vision is a key domain of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world.
            By processing digital images and videos, machines can identify objects, track movements, and make informed decisions based on visual inputs.
            The field combines traditional image processing techniques with modern deep learning architectures to achieve near-human or even superhuman accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Vision systems typically follow a structured pipeline—acquiring images, preprocessing them, extracting features, and applying models for inference.
            Each stage contributes to performance and reliability in real-world settings.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Image Preprocessing and Enhancement:</b> Techniques such as denoising, histogram equalization, and normalization prepare raw data for analysis by reducing artifacts caused by lighting or motion.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Feature Extraction:</b> Earlier methods like <i>SIFT</i> (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and <i>HOG</i> (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) were used to capture edges and textures. 
                Today, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically learn complex visual representations from data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Object Detection and Localization:</b> Models such as <i>YOLO (You Only Look Once)</i> and <i>SSD (Single Shot Detector)</i> identify and locate multiple objects in real time. 
                These systems are crucial in autonomous navigation and surveillance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Image Segmentation:</b> Deep architectures like <i>U-Net</i>, <i>Mask R-CNN</i>, and <i>DeepLab</i> divide images into meaningful regions, enabling pixel-level understanding for medical and industrial applications.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications Across Industries</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Vision has moved from research labs into nearly every sector. Below are some major use cases demonstrating its transformative potential:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Healthcare:</b> Automated image analysis assists doctors in diagnosing diseases from X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Models can detect tumors, fractures, or infections faster and with growing accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Autonomous Vehicles:</b> Vision-based perception systems allow self-driving cars to detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and road boundaries in real time, improving safety and navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Manufacturing:</b> High-resolution cameras coupled with AI inspect products for defects, ensuring consistent quality and reducing waste in production lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Retail and Analytics:</b> Retailers use vision systems for shelf monitoring, customer behavior analysis, and checkout automation, enhancing efficiency and user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Security and Surveillance:</b> Vision algorithms enable face recognition, anomaly detection, and crowd analysis to enhance public safety.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>AR/VR and Media:</b> Vision enables augmented and virtual reality experiences by tracking gestures, mapping environments, and blending real and digital content seamlessly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
            Despite impressive advancements, challenges remain. Computer Vision systems can struggle with domain shifts, poor lighting, occlusions, or biased data.
            Ethical considerations like surveillance privacy and fairness in facial recognition are becoming increasingly important.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future research focuses on multimodal understanding—combining vision with language and audio—to create more context-aware AI systems.
            Synthetic data generation, self-supervised learning, and efficient edge inference are shaping the next generation of vision applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, the goal of Computer Vision is not just to “see” but to <b>understand</b>—transforming pixels into actionable insights that augment human capability across every domain.
